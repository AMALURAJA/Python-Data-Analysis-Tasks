# Python-Data-Analysis-Tasks
This repository contains Python scripts for solving various data analysis and manipulation tasks using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These tasks are designed to showcase fundamental skills in Python for data analysis
## Tasks Overview

The following tasks are included in this repository:

### NumPy Tasks:
1. Create an array of ten zeros.  
2. Create an array of ten ones.  
3. Create an array of integers from ten to fifty.  
4. Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from zero to eight.  
5. Generate a random number between zero and one using NumPy.  
6. Generate an array of twenty-five random numbers sampled from a standard normal distribution.  
7. Create an array of twenty linearly spaced points between zero and one.  
8. Perform matrix operations on two 3x3 matrices.

### pandas Tasks:
9. Create a pandas DataFrame from a dictionary of lists.  
10. Load the Titanic dataset from Seaborn and check for missing values. Clean the dataset by dropping rows with missing values.  
11. Create a DataFrame with ten rows containing columns: ID, Name, Marks, and Grade. Then sort the data in ascending order based on marks.  

### Dataset Exploration:
12. Load the Iris dataset from Seaborn, display the first ten rows and last five rows, and provide basic insights about the dataset.  

### Visualization Tasks:
13. Load the Titanic dataset from Seaborn and recreate specific plots using Seaborn or Matplotlib. Ensure the axes and labels match the given specifications.
